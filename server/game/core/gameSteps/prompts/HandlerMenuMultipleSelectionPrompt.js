/**
 * General purpose menu prompt that allows the user to submit multiple choices at once.
 * Takes a choices object with menu options and an overall handler that is called when the user is done choosing.
 * Handlers should return true in order to complete the prompt.
 *
 * The properties option object may contain the following:
 * choices            - an array of titles for menu buttons
 * maxSelected        - the maximum number of choices the player is allowed to submit. Leave undefined to allow the player to submit any number.
 * handler            - a handler function that is called with the results of the prompt(which choices were selected) after the user clicks 'Done'
 * activePromptTitle  - the title that should be used in the prompt for the choosing player.
 * waitingPromptTitle - the title to display for opponents.
 * source             - what is at the origin of the user prompt, usually a card; used to provide a default waitingPromptTitle, if missing
