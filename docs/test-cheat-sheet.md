Useful when the test harness cannot automatically create a `this.<card>` reference because the player has multiple copies of a card. |

### Custom Expectations

| Name | Example Test | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| toHavePrompt | [Mon Mothma](test/server/cards/01_SOR/MonMothmaVoiceoftheRebellion.spec.ts) | Checks if the prompt's name or text matches (but not buttons) |
| toHaveEnabledPromptButton(s) | [Mon Mothma](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/MonMothmaVoiceoftheRebellion.spec.ts) | Checks if the prompt button is present and in an enabled state |
| toHaveDisabledPromptButton(s) | [Mon Mothma](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/MonMothmaVoiceoftheRebellion.spec.ts) | Checks if the prompt button is present and in a disabled state |
| toHaveExactPromptButtons | [Heroic Resolve](../test/server/cards/02_SHD/upgrades/HeroicResolve.spec.ts) | Checks for an exact set of button names in the current prompt, no more and no less. |
| toBeAbleToSelectExactly | [Surprise Strike](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/SurpriseStrike.spec.ts) | Checks that that specified player is able to select exactly the specified set of cards, no more and no less. |
| toBeInLocation | [I Am Your Father](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/SearchYourFeelings.spec.ts) | Checks that the provided card is in the specified game zone. Use this instead of `expect(<card>.location).toBe(...)` because it will check for inconsistency in game state. |
| toHaveExactUpgradeNames | [TIE Advanced](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/TieAdvanced.spec.ts) | Checks that the names of the provided card's upgrades match the provided list of card names. |
| toHaveAvailableActionWhenClickedBy | [Salacious Crumb](../test/server/cards/02_SHD/SalaciousCrumbObnoxiousPet.spec.ts) | Checks that the card, when clicked, causes an action to happen. Since this expectation changes game state, only use it at the end of a test (unless using the `.not` form) |
| toBeActivePlayer | [Fleet Lieutenant](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/FleetLieutenant.spec.ts) | Checks that the selected player is active player (i.e., is currently choosing or resolving their action) |
| toHavePassAbilityButton | [The Force is With Me](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/events/TheForceIsWithMe.spec.ts) | Checks that the selected player's current prompt includes the "Pass ability" button (typically used with target selectors) |
| toHavePassAbilityPrompt | [Superlaser Technician](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/units/SuperlaserTechnician.spec.ts) | Checks that the selected player's current prompt is the prompt to pass an ability |
| toBeAbleToSelect | N/A | Checks if the card is one of the cards selectable by the specified player. Better in most cases to use toBeAbleToSelectExactly as it will fail if there are other selectable cards. |
| toBeAbleToSelectAllOf | N/A | Checks if the cards are a subset of the cards selectable by the specified player. Better in most cases to use toBeAbleToSelectExactly as it will fail if there are other selectable cards. |
| toBeAbleToSelectNoneOf | N/A | Checks that the player cannot select any of the specified cards. Better in most cases to use toBeAbleToSelectExactly to specify the exact set of expected cards. |
| toBeInBottomOfDeck | [Mon Mothma](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/MonMothmaVoiceoftheRebellion.spec.ts) | Checks that the selected card is in the bottom N cards of the deck |
| toAllBeInBottomOfDeck | [Mon Mothma](../test/server/cards/01_SOR/MonMothmaVoiceoftheRebellion.spec.ts) | Checks that the selected cards are in the bottom N cards of the deck |
