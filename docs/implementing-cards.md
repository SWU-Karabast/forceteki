# Implementing Cards

To implement a card, follow these steps:

### Important note: legacy L5R code
This code was ported from the [Ringteki codebase](https://github.com/ringteki/ringteki) powering the online L5R client, Jigoku. During the initial implementation phase, we have included the legacy code from L5R under the folder [legacy_jigoku/](../legacy_jigoku/). These are included for reference as there is still a lot of useful code that hasn't been fully ported yet, but be careful when making changes or searching for files that you do not accidentally start doing your work in the L5R folder.

### Unit tests
We have a policy of creating at least one unit test with each new card. Please see the [Unit Testing Guide](./testing-cards.md) for details.

## Set up for implementation

### Find relevant info

#### Choose a card
For set 1 - 3 implementation we are maintaining a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ewhU2NMK7_N1ZzEzswJvmyz_UOenYHWW9pXfzDttFsg/edit?usp=sharing) for tracking which cards are ready to be implemented and who is working on which card. Please check this list before choosing a card to work on. If you are just getting started, please choose a card marked "Easy" to smooth the onboarding process.

_NOTE_: Our first goal is to implement the set 1 starter decks. If possible, please prioritize cards from those decks. They are marked with the "Starter Deck" checkbox.

Note that some cards are marked as **Trivial** in the document. These cards either have no text or only have keywords, which do not require explicit implementation. We will auto-generate implementation files for all trivial cards so do not choose one of these to implement manually.

#### Find a similar implementation
If you're just getting started or working on a more complex card, it can be very useful to find another card that has similar behavior and use its implementation as a starting point. 

Since we are still building up a catalog of SWU cards, you can also look through the catalog of L5R cards to see if you can find any that use similar key words / phrases. You can search [EmeraldDB](https://www.emeralddb.org/cards) and find the matching card implementation under [legacy_jigoku/server/game/cards](../legacy_jigoku/server/game/cards). Note that the repo has changed slightly from the L5R version so some details will have changed, the dev team can help with that (or with finding relevant card impls).

### Create a card file

Cards are organized under the `/server/game/cards` directory, grouped by set. Please make sure to match the PascalCase naming format of the other cards. All card implementation files must be in TypeScript (no vanilla JavaScript files). We recommend copy-pasting from another card implementation to get started.

#### Set class name and base class
Card class names should be PascalCase and match the file name exactly.

There is a specific base class that each card type should inherit from:

| Card Type | Base Class Name |
| --- | --- |
| Unit (non-leader, non-token) | NonLeaderUnitCard |
| Event | EventCard |
| Upgrade | UpgradeCard |
| Base | BaseCard |
| ~~Leader~~ | _Still WIP_ |
<!-- TODO LEADERS: fix the above table -->

Tokens require extra steps for implementation that will not be covered here.

#### Add ID data and implemented flag
Each card class should start with an override of `getImplementationId()` which returns the card's `id` and `internalName`. You can find these in the `test/json/_cardMap.json` file which is generated by the `npm run get-cards` command along with the card data files.

Copy-paste these values into the card impl file, and add a static class variable `<className>.implemented = true` to mark for the system that the card is implemented. The final result should look like below:

```javascript
import AbilityHelper from '../../AbilityHelper';
import { NonLeaderUnitCard } from '../../core/card/NonLeaderUnitCard';

export default class GroguIrresistible extends NonLeaderUnitCard {
    protected override getImplementationId() {
        return {
            id: '6536128825',
            internalName: 'grogu#irresistible'
        };
    }

    // implementation here
}

GroguIrresistible.implemented = true;
```

## Implement card abilities (quickstart)

The below is a quickstart guide on how to implement each ability type with some examples without going into too much detail on the components. See section **TODO: LINK HERE** for details on the building blocks of abilities.

All card abilities (i.e., any card text with an effect) should be defined in the `setupCardAbilities` method:

```javascript
class GroguIrresistible extends NonLeaderUnitCard {
    public override setupCardAbilities() {
        // Declare all ability types (action, triggered, constant, event, epic, replacement) here
        this.addActionAbility({
            title: 'Exhaust an enemy unit',
            cost: AbilityHelper.costs.exhaustSelf(),
            targetResolver: {
                controller: RelativePlayer.Opponent,
                immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.exhaust()
            }
        });
    }
}
```

There are several ability types in SWU, each with its own initialization method. As shown above in the example of an action ability, each method accepts a property object defining the ability's behavior. Use the `AbilityHelper` import to get access to tools to help with implementations. Additionally, see [Interfaces.ts](../server/game/Interfaces.ts) for a list of available parameters for each ability type.

The ability types and methods are:

| Ability Type | Method | Definition | Example Cards |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Constant ability | addConstantAbility | Abilities with no bold text that have an ongoing effect | [Entrenched](../server/game/cards/01_SOR/Entrenched.ts), [Sabine](../server/game/cards/01_SOR/SabineWrenExplosivesArtist.ts) |
| Action ability | addActionAbility | Abilities with bold text and a cost that provide an action the player can take | [Grogu](../server/game/cards/02_SHD/GroguIrresistible.ts), [Salacious Crumb](../server/game/cards/02_SHD/SalaciousCrumbObnoxiousPet.ts) |
| Triggered ability | addActionAbility | Abilities with bold text that trigger off of a game event to provide some effect | [Avenger](../server/game/cards/01_SOR/AvengerHuntingStarDestroyer.ts), [Fleet Lieutenant](../server/game/cards/01_SOR/FleetLieutenant.ts) |
| Event ability | setEventAbility | Any ability printed on an Event card | [Daring Raid](../server/game/cards/02_SHD/DaringRaid.ts), [Vanquish](../server/game/cards/01_SOR/Vanquish.ts) |
| Epic action ability | setEpicActionAbility | The Epic Action ability on a Base or Leader card | [Tarkintown](../server/game/cards/01_SOR/Tarkintown.ts) |
| Replacement ability | addReplacementAbility | Any ability using the term "would" or "instead" which modifies another effect | [Shield](../server/game/cards/01_SOR/Shield.ts) |
| Keyword ability | N/A, handled automatically | Abilities provided by keywords | See [keyword unit tests](../test/server/core/abilities/keyword/) |

Additionally, there are specific helper methods that extend the above to make common cases simpler, such as "onAttack" triggers or upgrades that cause the attached card to gain an ability or keyword. See the relevant section below for specific details.

### Keywords

Most Keywords (sentinel, raid, smuggle, etc.) are automatically parsed from the card text. It isn't necessary to explicitly implement them unless they are provided by a conditional ability. Some examples of keywords requiring explicit implementation:

- Baze Malbus: `While you have initiative, this unit gains Sentinel.`
- Red Three: `Each other [Heroic] unit gains Raid 1.`
- Protector: `Attached unit gains Restore 2.`

### Constant abilities

Many cards provide continuous bonuses to other cards you control or detrimental effects to opponents cards in certain situations. These abilities are referred to in SWU as "constant abilities" and can be defined using the `addConstantAbility` method. Cards that enter play while the constant ability is in play will automatically have the ongoing effect applied, and cards that leave play will have the effect removed. If the card providing the effect becomes blank, the ongoing effect is automatically removed from all previously applied cards.

For a full list of properties that can be set when declaring an ongoing effect, look at [OngoingEffect.js](../server/game/core/ongoingEffect/OngoingEffect.js) _(NOTE: this is possibly stale)_. To see all the types of effect which you can use (and whether they apply to cards or players), look at [EffectLibrary.js](../server/game/ongoingEffects/OngoingEffectLibrary.ts). Here are some common scenarios:

#### Matching conditions vs matching specific cards

The ongoing effect declaration (for card effects, not player effects) takes a `matchTarget` property. In most cases this will be a function that takes a `Card` object and should return `true` if the ongoing effect should be applied to that card.

```javascript
// Each Rebel unit you control gains +1/+1
this.constantAbility({
    matchTarget: card => card.hasSomeTrait(Trait.Rebel),
    ongoingEffect: AbilityHelper.ongoingEffects.modifyStats({ power: 1, hp: 1 }),
});
```

In some cases, an ongoing effect should be applied to a specific card. While you could write a `matchTarget` function to match only that card, you can provide the `Card` or `Player` object as a shorthand.

```javascript
// This player's leader unit gets Sentinel while it is deployed (i.e., in the arena)
this.constantAbility({
    matchTarget: this.controller.leader,
    targetLocationFilter: WildcardLocation.AnyArena,
    ongoingEffect: AbilityHelper.ongoingEffects.gainKeyword(KeywordName.Sentinel),
});
```

If not provided, `matchTarget` will default to targeting only the card that owns the constant ability.

#### Conditional ongoing effects

Some ongoing effects have a 'when', 'while' or 'if' clause within their text. These cards can be implemented by passing a `condition` function into the constant ability declaration. The ongoing effect will only be applied when the function returns `true`. If the function returns `false` later on, the ongoing effect will be automatically unapplied from the cards it matched.

```javascript
// While this unit is exhausted, it gains +1/+1
this.constantAbility({
    condition: () => this.exhausted,
    ongoingEffect: AbilityHelper.ongoingEffects.modifyStats({ power: 1, hp: 1 })
});
```

#### Filtering by card type, owner, location
Note also that, similar to target resolvers described below, there are shorthand filters for the card properties location, owner, and card type. See section [Target filtering](#target-filtering) below for more details.

All of these filters are available for filtering target cards (e.g., `targetLocationFilter`), but for checking the properties of the source card (the card that owns the ability) only `sourceLocationFilter` is available:

```javascript
// While this card is in the ground arena, all of the opponent's units in the space arena get -1/-1
this.constantAbility({
    sourceLocationFilter: Location.GroundArena,
    targetLocationFilter: Location.SpaceArena,
    targetCardType: WildcardCardType.Unit,
    targetController: RelativePlayer.Opponent,
    ongoingEffect: AbilityHelper.ongoingEffects.modifyStats({ power: -1, hp: -1 })
});
```

#### Applying multiple effects at once
As a shorthand, it is possible to pass an array into the `ongoingEffect` property to apply multiple effects that have the same conditions / matching functions.

```javascript
// This unit gets Sentinel and +1/+1 while damaged
this.constantAbility({
    condition: () => this.damage !== 0,
    effect: [
        AbilityHelper.ongoingEffects.gainKeyword(KeywordName.Sentinel),
        AbilityHelper.ongoingEffects.modifyStats({ power: -1, hp: -1 })
    ]
});
```

#### Helper methods for upgrade cards
Some helper methods are available to make it easier to declare constant abilities on upgrades, since these are extremely common.

##### Static stat bonuses from upgrades

Static upgrade stat bonuses from the printed upgrade values are automatically included in combat calculations for the attached unit.

##### Effects targeting attached card

Since most upgrade abilities target the attached card, we have helper methods available to declare such abilities succintly.

Most upgrades say that the attached unit gains a triggered ability:
```javascript
// Attached character gains ability 'On Attack: Exhaust the defender'
this.addGainTriggeredAbilityTargetingAttached({
    title: 'Exhaust the defender on attack',
    // note here that context.source refers to the attached unit card, not the upgrade itself
    when: { onAttackDeclared: (event, context) => event.attack.attacker === context.source },
    targetResolver: {
        cardCondition: (card, context) => card === context.event.attack.target,
        immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.exhaust()
    }
});
```

It is also common for an upgrade to grant a keyword to the attached:
```javascript
// Attached character gains keyword 'Restore 2'
this.addGainKeywordTargetingAttached({
    keyword: KeywordName.Restore,
    amount: 2
});
```

In some rare cases an upgrade's ability targets the attached card without giving it any new abilities
```javascript
// Entrenched ability
this.addConstantAbilityTargetingAttached({
    title: 'Attached unit cannot attack bases',
    ongoingEffect: AbilityHelper.ongoingEffects.cannotAttackBase(),
});
```

<!-- TODO: update this section -->
#### **IGNORE THIS SECTION, STILL WIP**: ~~Applying effects to cards which aren't in play~~

By default, ongoing effects will only be applied to cards in the play area.  Certain cards effects refer to cards in your hand, such as reducing their cost. In these cases, set the `targetLocation` property to `'hand'`.

```javascript
// Each Direwolf card in your hand gains ambush (X). X is that card's printed cost.
this.constantAbility({
    // Explicitly target the effect to cards in hand.
    targetLocationFilter: 'hand',
    match: card => card.hasTrait('Direwolf'),
    effect: AbilityHelper.effects.modifyCost()
});
```

This also applies to provinces, holdings and strongholds, which the game considers to be 'in play' even though they aren't in the play area.  Where an effect needs to be applied to these cards (or to characters who are in a province), set `targetLocation` to `'province'`.

```javascript
// This province gets +5 strength during [political] conflicts.
this.constantAbility({
    match: this,
    targetLocation: 'province',
    condition: () => this.game.isDuringConflict('political'),
    effect: AbilityHelper.effects.modifyProvinceStrength(5)
});
```

<!-- TODO: update this section -->
#### **IGNORE THIS SECTION, STILL WIP**: ~~Player modifying effects~~

Certain cards provide bonuses or restrictions on the player itself instead of on any specific cards. These effects are marked as `Player` effects in `/server/game/effects.js`. For player effects, `targetController` indicates which players the effect should be applied to (with `'current'` acting as the default). Player effects should not have a `match` property.

```javascript
// While this character is participating in a conflict, opponents cannot play events.
this.constantAbility({
    condition: () => this.isParticipating(),
    targetController: 'opponent',
    effect: AbilityHelper.effects.playerCannot(context => context.source.type === 'event')
});
```

### Action abilities

Action abilities are abilities from card text with the bold text **"Action [_one or more costs_]:"**, followed by an effect. This provides an action the player may trigger during the action phase. They are declared using the `addActionAbility` method. See [ActionAbility.ts](../server/game/core/ability/ActionAbility.ts) for full documentation (_NOTE: may be stale_). Here are some common scenarios:

#### Declaring an action

When declaring an action, use the `addActionAbility` method and provide it with a `title` property. The title is what will be displayed in the menu players see when clicking on the card.

```javascript
export default class GroguIrresistible extends NonLeaderUnitCard {
    public override setupCardAbilities() {
        this.addActionAbility({
            title: 'Exhaust an enemy unit',
            cost: AbilityHelper.costs.exhaustSelf(),
            targetResolver: {
                controller: RelativePlayer.Opponent,
                immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.exhaust()
            }
        });
    }
}
```

#### Checking ability restrictions

To ensure that the action's play restrictions are met, pass a `condition` function that returns `true` when the restrictions are met, and `false` otherwise. If the condition returns `false`, the action will not be executed and costs will not be paid.

```javascript
// Give this unit +2/+2, but the action is only available if the friendly leader is deployed
this.action({
    title: 'Give this unit +2/+2',
    condition: () => this.controller.leader.isDeployed(),
    // ...
});
```

#### Paying additional costs for action

Some actions have an additional cost, such as bowing the card. In these cases, specify the `cost` parameter. The action will check if the cost can be paid. If it can't, the action will not execute. If it can, costs will be paid automatically and then the action will execute.

For a full list of costs, look at [CostLibrary.ts](../server/game/costs/CostLibrary.ts).

One example is Salacious Crumb's action ability, which has two costs - exhaust the card and return it to hand:
```javascript
public override setupCardAbilities() {
    this.addActionAbility({
        title: 'Deal 1 damage to a ground unit',
        cost: [
            AbilityHelper.costs.exhaustSelf(),
            AbilityHelper.costs.returnSelfToHandFromPlay()
        ],
        cannotTargetFirst: true,
        targetResolver: {
            locationFilter: Location.GroundArena,
            immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.damage({ amount: 1 }),
        }
    });
}
```

### Triggered abilities

Triggered abilities are abilities with bold text indicating a game event to be triggered off. Typical examples are "When played," "On attack," and "When defeated." Implementing a triggered ability is similar to action abilities above, except that we use `this.addTriggeredAbility`. Costs and targets (discussed below) are declared in the same way. For full documentation of properties, see [TriggeredAbility.ts](../server/game/core/ability/TriggeredAbility.ts). Here are some common scenarios:

#### Defining the triggering condition

Each triggered ability has an associated triggering condition. This is done using the `when` property. This should be an object with one property which named for the name of the event - see `EventName` in [Constants.ts](server\game\core\Constants.ts) for a current list of available events to trigger on. The value of the `when` property should be a function which takes the event and the context object. When the function returns `true`, the ability will be executed.

Here is an example with the deployed Cassian leader ability:
```javascript
this.reaction({
    // When damage is dealt to an enemy base, draw a card
    when: {
    	onDamageDealt: (event, context) => event.target.isBase() && event.target.controller !== context.source.controller
    },
    immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.drawCard(),
    limit: AbilityHelper.limit.perRound(1)
});
```

#### Triggering condition helpers

There are several ability triggers that are extremely common. For these, we provide helper methods which wrap the `when` clause so that it doesn't need to be typed out every time. For example, Mon Mothma's "when played" ability:

```javascript
this.addWhenPlayedAbility({
    title: 'Search the top 5 cards of your deck for a Rebel card, then reveal and draw it.',
    immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.deckSearch({
        searchCount: 5,
        cardCondition: (card) => card.hasSomeTrait(Trait.Rebel),
        selectedCardsImmediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.drawSpecificCard()
    })
});
```

The following triggers have helper methods:

| Trigger | Helper method |
| --- | --- |
| When played | addWhenPlayedAbility |
| On attack | addOnAttackAbility |
| ~~On defeat~~ | TBD |
<!-- TODO: update the above table when we add a when defeated card trigger example -->

#### Optionally triggered abilities
If the triggered ability uses the word "may," then the ability is considered optional and the player may choose to pass it when it is triggered. In these cases, the triggered ability must be flagged with the "optional" property. For example, Fleet Lieutenant's ability:

```javascript
this.addWhenPlayedAbility({
    title: 'Attack with a unit',
    optional: true,
    initiateAttack: {
        effects: AbilityHelper.ongoingEffects.conditionalAttackStatBonus(
            (attacker: UnitCard) => attacker.hasSomeTrait(Trait.Rebel),
            { power: 2, hp: 0 }
        )
    }
});
```

#### Multiple triggers
In some cases there may be multiple triggering conditions for the same ability, such as Avenger's ability being triggered on play and on attack. In these cases, just define an additional event on the `when` object. For example, see the ability on The Ghost:
```javascript
this.addTriggeredAbility({
    title: 'Give a shield to another Spectre unit',
    when: {
        onCardPlayed: (event, context) => event.card === context.source,
        onAttackDeclared: (event, context) => event.attack.attacker === context.source
    },
    targetResolver: {
        cardCondition: (card, context) => card.hasSomeTrait(Trait.Spectre) && 
        immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.defeat()
    }
});
```

<!-- TODO: update this section -->
#### **IGNORE THIS SECTION, STILL WIP**: ~~Abilities outside of play~~

Certain abilities, such as that of Vengeful Oathkeeper can only be activated in non-play locations. Such reactions should be defined by specifying the `location` property with the location from which the ability may be activated. The player can then activate the ability when prompted.

```javascript
this.reaction({
	when: {
		afterConflict: (event, context) => context.conflict.loser === context.player && context.conflict.conflictType === 'military'
	},
    location: 'hand',
    gameAction: AbilityHelper.actions.putIntoPlay()
})
```

### Event abilities
All ability text printed on an event card is considered the "event ability" for that card. Event abilities are defined exactly the same way as action abilities, except that there can only be one ability defined and it uses the `setEventAbility` method. E.g. Daring Raid:

```javascript
this.setEventAbility({
    title: 'Deal 2 damage to a unit or base',
    targetResolver: {
        immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.damage({ amount: 2 })
    }
});
```

### Epic action abilities
Epic action abilities are printed on leader and base cards, and can only be activated once per game. Like event cards, they are defined the same way as action abilities except that only one can be set and it is set using the `setEpicActionAbility` method. See Tarkintown:

```javascript
this.setEpicActionAbility({
    title: 'Deal 3 damage to a damaged non-leader unit',
    targetResolver: {
        cardTypeFilter: CardType.NonLeaderUnit,
        cardCondition: (card) => (card as UnitCard).damage !== 0,
        immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.damage({ amount: 3 })
    }
});
```

### Replacement effects
Some abilities allow the player to cancel or modify an effect. These abilities are always defined with the word "instead" or "would." Some examples:
- Shield, which cancels the normal resolution of damage and replaces it with another effect (defeating the shield token)
- Boba Fett's armor, which modifies the normal resolution of an instance of damage and reduces its value by 2

These abilities are called "replacement effects" in the SWU rules and are defined using the `addReplacementEffectAbility` method. Otherwise the ability is defined very similar to a triggered ability, except that it has a `replaceWith` property object which defines an optional replacement effect in the `replacementImmediateEffect` sub-property. If `replacementImmediateEffect` is null, the triggering effect is canceled with no replacement. An optional `target` sub-property is also availabe to define a target for the replacement effect.

Here is the Shield implementation as an example:
```javascript
this.addReplacementEffectAbility({
    title: 'Defeat shield to prevent attached unit from taking damage',
    when: {
        onDamageDealt: (event, context) => event.card === (context.source as UpgradeCard).parentCard
    },
    replaceWith: {
        target: this,
        replacementImmediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.defeat()
    },
    effect: 'shield prevents {1} from taking damage',
    effectArgs: (context) => [(context.source as UpgradeCard).parentCard],
});
```

## Ability building blocks
This section describes some of the major components that are used in the definitions of abilities:
- Context objects
- Game systems
- Target resolvers

### Context object

When the game starts to resolve an ability, it creates a context object for that ability. Generally, the context ability has the following structure:

```javascript
class AbilityContext {
    constructor(properties) {
        this.game = properties.game;
        this.source = properties.source || new OngoingEffectSource(this.game);
        this.player = properties.player;
        this.ability = properties.ability || null;
        this.costs = properties.costs || {};
        this.costAspects = properties.costAspects || [];
        this.targets = properties.targets || {};
        this.selects = properties.selects || {};
        this.stage = properties.stage || Stage.Effect;
        this.targetAbility = properties.targetAbility;
        this.playType = this.player && this.player.findPlayType(this.source);
    }
}
```

`context.source` is the card with the ability being used, and `context.player` is the player who is using the ability (almost always the controller of the `context.source`). When implementing actions and other triggered abilities, `context` should almost always be used (instead of `this`) to reference cards or players.  The only exception is that `this.game` can be used as an alternative to `context.game`.

#### `context.source` and upgrades

Note that in the case of upgrade abilities that give an ability to the attached card, `context.source` has to be used slightly differently than normal:
```javascript
// Attached character gains ability 'On Attack: Exhaust the defender'
this.addGainTriggeredAbilityTargetingAttached({
    title: 'Exhaust the defender on attack',
    // note here that context.source refers to the attached unit card, not the upgrade itself
    when: { onAttackDeclared: (event, context) => event.attack.attacker === context.source },
    targetResolver: {
        cardCondition: (card, context) => card === context.event.attack.target,
        immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.exhaust()
    }
});
```
Whereas in most cases `context.source` refers to `this` (i.e., the source card of the ability), since in this case the ability is being triggered on the attached unit card, `context.source` refers to the unit that the upgrade is attached to. The above `when` condition is equivalent to:

`when: { onAttackDeclared: (event, context) => event.attack.attacker === this.parentCard }`

### Target resolvers

Most ability types (other than constant, keyword, and replacement abilities) can specify to 'choose' or otherwise target a specific card. This should be implemented using a "target resolver," which defines a set of criteria that will be used to select the set of target cards to allow the player to choose between. Target resolvers are provided using `targetResolver` or `targetResolvers` property. 

The `targetResolver` property should include any limitations set by the ability, using the `cardTypeFilter`, `locationFilter`, `controller` and/or `cardCondition` property. A game system can also be included by using the `immediateEffect` property, which will restrict the card chosen to those for which that game system is legal (e.g. only units in an arena and base can be damaged, only upgrades can be unattached, etc.).

For example, see the Sabine Wren (unit) "on attack" ability:
```javascript
// cardCondition returns true only for cards that are a base or the target of Sabine's attack
this.addOnAttackAbility({
    title: 'Deal 1 damage to the defender or a base',
    targetResolver: {
        cardCondition: (card, context) => card.isBase() || card === context.event.attack.target,
        immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.damage({ amount: 1 })
    }
});
```

See additional details in the [GameSystems](#game-systems) section below. If an array of game systems is specified in `immediateEffect`, then the target only needs to meet the requirements of one of them.

#### Target filtering
As mentioned above, targets can be filtered using one of multiple properties. The `cardCondition` property is the most flexible but the most cumbersome to write and to read, as it requires passing a handler function. Since most ability targets are restricted by a simple category such as "non-leader unit" or "friendly ground unit", properties are available for filtering on these attributes (see example below).

**'Wildcard' enum types:** for location and card type, we have a concept of "wildcard" enum types which represent more than one concrete value. For example, `Location.SpaceArena` and `Location.GroundArena` are concrete locations, but `WildcardLocation.AnyArena` is a value that represents both (or either) for matching and filtering purposes. Similarly for card types, we have values such as `WildcardCardType.Unit` which represents leader and non-leader units as well as token units. For a detailed list, see [Constants.ts](server\game\core\Constants.ts).

```javascript
// Death Trooper
this.addWhenPlayedAbility({
    title: 'Deal 2 damage to a friendly ground unit and an enemy ground unit',
    targetResolvers: {
        myGroundUnit: {
            cardTypeFilter: WildcardCardType.Unit,
            controller: RelativePlayer.Self,
            locationFilter: Location.GroundArena,
            immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.damage({ amount: 2 })
        },
        theirGroundUnit: {
            cardTypeFilter: WildcardCardType.Unit,
            controller: RelativePlayer.Opponent,
            locationFilter: Location.GroundArena,
            immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.damage({ amount: 2 })
        }
    },
    effect: 'deal 2 damage to {1} and {2}',
    effectArgs: (context) => [context.targets.myGroundUnit, context.targets.theirGroundUnit]
});
```

#### Multiple targets

Some card abilities require multiple targets. These may be specified using the `targetResolvers` property. Each sub key under `targetResolvers` is the name that will be given to the chosen card, and the value is the prompt properties. See the Death Trooper example above for reference.

Once all targets are chosen, they will be set using their specified name under the `targetResolvers` property on the handler context object.

<!-- TODO: update this section -->
#### **IGNORE FOR NOW, WIP:** ~~Select options~~

Some abilities require the player (or their opponent) to choose between multiple options.  This is done in the same way as targets above, but by using the `mode` property set to `'select'`.  In addition, a `choices` object should be included, which contains key:value pairs where the key is the option to display to the player, and the value is either a function which takes the `context` object and returns a boolean indicating whether this option is legal, or a game action which will be evaluated on the basis of the specified target (or default as detailed below) to determine whether the choice is legal.  The selected option is stored in `context.select.choice` (or `context.selects[targetName].choice` for an ability with multiple targets).

```javascript
// Action: During a conflict at this province, select one – switch the contested ring with an unclaimed 
// ring, or switch the conflict type.
this.action({
    title: 'Switch the conflict type or ring',
    condition: context => context.source.isConflictProvince(),
    target: {
        player: 'self',
        mode: 'select',
        choices: {
            'Switch the contested ring': () => _.any(this.game.rings, ring => ring.isUnclaimed()),
            'Switch the conflict type': () => true
        }
    },
    // ...
});
```

```javascript
// Action: If an opponent has declared 2 or more conflicts against you this phase, select one – 
// take 1 fate or 1 honor from that opponent.
this.action({
    title: 'Take 1 fate or 1 honor',
    phase: 'conflict',
    condition: context => this.game.getConflicts(context.player.opponent).filter(conflict => !conflict.passed).length > 1,
    target: {
        player: 'self',
        mode: 'select',
        choices: {
            'Take 1 fate': AbilityHelper.actions.takeFate(),
            'Take 1 honor': AbilityHelper.actions.takeHonor()
        }
    }
});
```

### Using GameSystems for building ability effects

In general, the effects of an ability should be implemented using game systems represented by the GameSystem class, which is turn wrapped by helper methods under the AbilityHelper import.

#### Game Systems

All ability types rely on GameSystems for making changes to game state.  Available game systems can be found in [GameSystemLibrary.ts](server\game\gameSystems\GameSystemLibrary.ts), along with any parameters and their defaults. The `cost` and `immediateEffect` fields of `AbilityHelper` provide access to the GameSystem classes for use in changing the game state as either the cost or the immediate effect of an ability, respectively. For example, the Grogu action ability uses the exhaust both as a cost (via `AbilityHelper.costs.exhaustSelf()`) and as an effect (via `AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.exhaust()`).

```javascript
this.addActionAbility({
    title: 'Exhaust an enemy unit',
    cost: AbilityHelper.costs.exhaustSelf(),
    targetResolver: {
        controller: RelativePlayer.Opponent,
        immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.exhaust()
    }
});
```

Game systems as an immediate effect default to targeting the card generating the ability (for cards) or the opponent (for players).

Game systems included in `targetResolver` (or in one of `targetResolvers`) will default to the target chosen by the `targetResolver`'s resolution. You can change the target of a game system or the parameters by passing either an object with the properties you want, or a function which takes `context` and returns those properties.

```javascript
this.addActionAbility({
    title: 'Defeat this upgrade to give the attached unit a shield',
    cost: AbilityHelper.costs.defeatSelf(),
    // we don't need a target resolver, can just provide the target directly here
    immediateEffect: AbilityHelper.immediateEffects.giveShield(context => ({ target: context.source.parentCard }))
});
```

#### Limiting the number of uses

Some actions have text limiting the number of times they may be used in a given period. You can pass an optional `limit` property using one of the duration-specific ability limiters. See `/server/game/abilitylimit.js` for more details.

```javascript
this.addActionAbility({
    title: 'Damage an opponent\'s base',
    limit: AbilityHelper.limit.perPhase(1),
    // ...
});
```

#### Effect messages **EXAMPLES NEED UPDATING**

Once costs have been paid and targets chosen (but before the ability resolves), the game automatically displays a message in the chat box which tells both players the ability, costs and targets of the effect.  Game actions will automatically generate their own effect message, although this will only work for a single game action.  If the effects of the ability involve two or more game actions, or the effect is a lasting effect or uses a handler, then an `effect` property is required.  The effect property will be passed the target (card(s) or ring) of the effect (or the source if there are no targets) as its first parameter (and so can be referenced using `'{0}'` in the effect property string).  If other references are required, this can be done using curly bracket references in the effect string(`'{1}', '{2', etc`) and supplying an `effectArgs` property (which generally will be a function taking the `context` object):

```javascript
this.action({
    // Action: Return this attachment to your hand and dishonor attached character.
    title: 'Return court mask to hand',
    effect: 'return {0} to hand, dishonoring {1}',
    effectArgs: context => context.source.parent,
    gameAction: [AbilityHelper.actions.returnToHand(), AbilityHelper.actions.dishonor(context => ({ target: context.source.parent }))]
});
```

```javascript
this.action({
    // Action: While this character is participating in a conflict, choose another participating character – until the end of the conflict, that character gets +2/+2 for each holding you control.
    title: 'Give a character a bonus for each holding',
    condition: context => context.source.isParticipating(),
    target: {
        cardType: 'character',
        cardCondition: (card, context) => card.isParticipating() && card !== context.source,
        gameAction: AbilityHelper.actions.cardLastingEffect(context => ({
            effect: AbilityHelper.effects.modifyBothSkills(2 * context.player.getNumberOfHoldingsInPlay())
        }))
    },
    effect: 'give {0} +{1}{2}/+{1}{3}',
    effectArgs: context => [2 * context.player.getNumberOfHoldingsInPlay(), 'military', 'political']
});
```

<!-- TODO: update this section -->
#### **IGNORE THIS, STILL WIP:** ~~Lasting effects~~

Unlike constant abilities, "lasting" effects are typically applied during an action or triggered ability and expire after a specified period of time.  Lasting effects use the same properties as constant abilities, above.  Lasting effects are applied using the `cardLastingEffect` or `playerLastingEffect`, depending on what they affect.  They take a `duration:` property which is one of `untilEndOfAttack` (default), `untilEndOfPhase` or `untilEndOfRound`.

```javascript
// Action: During a conflict, bow this character. Choose another [crane] character – that character 
// gets +3 [political] until the end of the conflict.
this.action({
    title: 'Give a character +0/+3',
    condition: () => this.game.isDuringConflict(),
    cost: AbilityHelper.costs.bowSelf(),
    target: {
        cardType: 'character',
        cardCondition: (card, context) => card !== context.source && card.isFaction('crane'),
        gameAction: AbilityHelper.actions.cardLastingEffect(() => ({
            duration: 'untilEndOfConflict',
            effect: AbilityHelper.effects.modifyPoliticalSkill(3)
        }))
    },
    effect: 'give {0} +3{1} skill',
    effectArgs: () => 'political'
});

```

To apply an effect to last until the end of the current phase, use `untilEndOfPhase`:
```javascript
// Action: Reduce the cost of the next event you play this phase by 1.
this.action({
    title: 'Reduce cost of next event by 1',
    effect: 'reduce the cost of their next event by 1',
    gameAction: AbilityHelper.actions.playerLastingEffect({
        duration: 'untilEndOfPhase',
        effect: AbilityHelper.effects.reduceNextPlayedCardCost(1, card => card.type === 'event')
    })
});
```

To apply an effect to last until the end of the round, use `untilEndOfRound`:
```javascript
/// Action: Choose a holding you control – you may trigger each of that holding's triggered abilities an additional time this round (or specified period).
this.action({
    title: 'Add an additional ability use to a holding',
    target: {
        cardType: 'holding',
        location: 'province',
        controller: 'self',
        gameAction: AbilityHelper.actions.cardLastingEffect({
            duration: 'untilEndOfPhase',
            targetLocation: 'province',
            effect: AbilityHelper.effects.increaseLimitOnAbilities()
        })
    },
    effect: 'add an additional use to each of {0}\'s abilities'
});
```

<!-- TODO: update this section -->
#### **IGNORE THIS, STILL WIP:** ~~Actions outside of play~~

Certain actions, such as that of Ancestral Guidance, can only be activated while the character is in the discard pile. Such actions should be defined by specifying the `location` property with the location from which the ability may be activated. The player can then activate the ability by simply clicking the card. If there is a conflict (e.g. both the ability and playing the card normally can occur), then the player will be prompted.

```javascript
this.action({
    title: 'Play from discard pile',
    location: 'conflict discard pile',
    // ...
})
```

### Language

#### Game messages should begin with the player doing the action

Game messages should begin with the name of the player to ensure a uniform format and make it easy to see who triggered an ability.

* **Bad**: Kaiu Shuichi triggers to gain 1 fate for Player1
* **Good**: Player1 uses Kaiu Shuichi to gain 1 fate

#### Game messages should not end in punctuation

No game messages should end in a period, exclaimation point or question mark.

* **Bad**: Player1 draws 2 cards.
* **Good**: Player1 draws 2 cards

#### Game messages should use present tense.

All game messages should use present tense.

* **Bad**: Player1 has used Isawa Masahiro to discard Miya Mystic
* **Bad**: Player1 chose to discard Miya Mystic
* **Good**: Player1 uses Isawa Masahiro to discard Miya Mystic
* **Good**: Player1 chooses to discard Miya Mystic

#### Targeting prompts should use the format "Choose a \<card type\>" where possible.

Targeting prompts should ask the player to choose a card or a card of particular type to keep prompt titles relatively short, without specifying the final goal of card selection.

* **Bad**: Choose a character to return to hand
* **Good**: Choose a character

**Exception:** If a card requires the player to choose multiple cards (e.g. Rebuild), or if a card requires the player's opponent to choose a card (e.g. Endless Plains) you can add context about which one they should be selecting. Just keep it as short as reasonably possible.

As valid selections are already presented to the user via visual clues, targeting prompts should not repeat selection rules in excessive details. Specifying nothing more and nothing less than the eligible card type (if any) is the good middle ground (this is what most prompts will default to).

* **Bad**: Choose a Bushi
* **Good**: Choose a character

* **Bad**: Choose a defending Crab character
* **Good**: Choose a character

* **Bad**: Choose a card from your discard pile
* **Good**: Choose a card

* **Good**: Choose an attachment or location
